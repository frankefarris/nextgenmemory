# NexGen Memory System
NexGen Memory System – Proof of Performance

🚀 50,000× faster than MongoDB. 97,000× faster than Elasticsearch. Cryptographically proven.

This repository does not contain the algorithm or source code of NexGen Memory System (patent pending).
Instead, it publishes independent benchmark results, cryptographic proof files, and instructions for verifying claims.
